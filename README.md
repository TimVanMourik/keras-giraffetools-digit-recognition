# Digit Recognition with Keras & GiraffeTools
A machine learning network for digit recognition in GiraffeTools. The neural network is visualised, modified, and saved via the link here:

The business logic for loading data and feeding it to the model is included in main Python file `digit_recognition.py`.

For easy inspection, there is also a Jupyter notebook (`digit_recognition.ipynb`) that is equivalent but also shows some output here and there. Like an input image:

That is classified and decided to be an 8:
